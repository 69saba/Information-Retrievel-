# Information Reterivel 

## ABSTRACT
The use of the Internet has fully-fledged intensely over the past few years. Information resources are available all over, both in internal networks and on the Internet. This progress represents an implausible means of information. The increasing amount of information requires information retrieval (IR) systems for users to access information efficiently. The main goal of Information Retrieval is to develop systems that would let users access all information resources available in the network. For this purpose we use (ETL) tools to extract data from multiple, assorted data sources, transform data, and finally load data into the database and data mining. Data quality is so important for accurate, complete, and efficient data to be provided to the user.
## ABOUT RECIPES INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
Information retrieval is dependent on a user's queries. To make the document more convenient, the query and content in the document are consistent. To eliminate extraneous data and arrive at more exact results, information retrieval techniques are used. Finding relevant information quickly within large amounts of data and ranking the findings according to relevancy. As a result, IR systems provide users with online access to information they may not be aware of, and they are not required to know or care where the information is stored. Users can inquire with a single search.
## GETTING STARTED
To evolve various recipes over the internet we need some way to collect all the recipe data. The technique we imply to gather all the recipe relevant data is data extraction and the tool we use for this purpose is Visual Web Ripper.
## 1-	INSTALLING VISUAL WEB RIPPER
Visual Web Ripper is a powerful web page scraper used to easily extract website data, such as product catalogs, classifieds, financial web sites or any other web site that contains information you may Excel, MySQL db file, SQL Lite db file.
*	Data Extraction Using Visual Web Ripper and Recipes Script
Recipes Script generates out .rip file. In the script, we define the recipe model if present for the website. For script generation and execution of it according to requirements, we follow a specified schema that assists us in every step of data extraction and how we structure it during extraction for late use.First, we give it a template Page Area and save it,next we give it a Link that would help us continue to the next page and name them as “recipeCategoryList” and “recipeCategory” respectively.

For the next step, we take in a list of recipes in the template of Page Area and select all our recipes and will name it as “recipeList”.

After saving the same area as “recipes” we make a link of those selected items and give them the template of Link.

This list will help us open each recipe and is named as “recipe”. Once we have provided all the present content of the recipe constituents and gave them names according to the provided schema, we save the script and the file as a Visual Web Ripper Project (.rip).

Next comes the extraction. We will extract the website by running our project. It will take some time to get done. The time for extraction varies depending upon the size of the website.
